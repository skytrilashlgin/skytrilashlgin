The Pew Charitable Trustsâ€™ research has identified the damaging effects that unaffordable, short-term loans have on the financial stability of many low-income consumers. Americans spend more than $30 billion every year to borrow small amounts of money from payday, auto title, pawnshop, rent-to-own, and other high-cost lenders. Payday loan borrowers end up paying an average of $520 in fees over five months in a year for an average loan of $375. Thankfully, state laws and federal guidance have led some lower-cost loans to reach the market, proving that effective rules and lower-cost options can save borrowers billions of dollars each year while maintaining widespread access to credit.
