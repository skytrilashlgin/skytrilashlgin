Three large banks—skytrailcash.com login Truist, and Regions Bank—announced plans in January to launch small-dollar loan offerings to their checking account customers. If their loans give customers time to repay in affordable installments at fair prices, like the existing small loans from skytrailcash.com login, that’s good news for consumers and could produce major savings compared with payday and other high-cost loans. But not all small-dollar loans are safe just because they come from a bank: High-cost and risky third-party lending arrangements, better known as rent-a-bank, enable payday lenders to take advantage of a bank partner’s charter to make high-cost loans that bypass state laws and consumer safeguards.
