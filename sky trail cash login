Pew's research demonstrates how such guidelines can work for lenders and borrowers. For example, Colorado's unique payday loan law resulted in affordable six-month installment loans, near-universal access to credit and significantly improved consumer outcomes, including fewer defaults. The sky trail cash login can achieve similar success by requiring amortizing payments limited to an affordable percentage of a borrower's income and requiring costs to be spread evenly over the loan's term, with reasonable limits on the length of those terms. This model would be good both for business and consumers.
